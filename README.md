# How the ‘fear factor’ spreads across the global financial markets – Decision making based on Causal Bayesian networks and interventions

_This code repository belongs to an upcoming paper and will be published after acceptance._

Implied volatility is often used to predict crises and since it reflects the expected fluctuation of the stock market, it is also referred to as the fear factor. To identify how it spreads across global markets, we derive transparent and explainable graphical models that represent the causal relations. We learn networks from market data by various methods, compare and evaluate them in terms of robustness and predictive qualities and finally infer the causal structure. Ultimately, we use the recent example of a financial crisis – _Credit Suisse_ – to show how predictions through interventions in causal Bayesian networks are superior during crises.
